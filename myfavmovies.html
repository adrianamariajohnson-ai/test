<center><h1>I love to watch movies! Here are some of my favorite:</h1>
<ul>
  <li><h3>Frozen 2, although the first one is iconic, the second one I just like more because its more focused on Elsa and her powers</h3></li>
  <li><h3>The Book of Life might just be my favorite movie, the story and art is beautiful, the music is amazing, and it makes me cry every time I watch</h3></li>
  <li><h3>Sinners is such an amazing movie that deserves even more praise than it received.</h3></li>
